# Note Taking Website App Using Pure JavaScript.

We all have a notes app on our mobiles or laptop. Note-taking websites are the online equivalent of notebooks, and because they are digital, they can do more for you than paper ever could. You can even build a more advanced level note-taking website, but I will keep it simple for now, as it is my first JavaScript project!
